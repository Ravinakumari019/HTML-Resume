Portfolio Resume Website

Built a personal resume website using HTML5 semantic tags to present my profile, skills, projects, certifications, and contact details.
Focused on clean structure, accessibility, and proper webpage hierarchy using header, nav, main, section, and footer.

This project serves as a simple digital resume for recruiters and learning semantic web development.
